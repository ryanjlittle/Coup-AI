# Coup-AI
A script that can play the card game Coup. I designed it so I could play the AI's moves against my friends in an in-person game in real time. 

The AI uses an [ISMCTS](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75048/1/CowlingPowleyWhitehouse2012.pdf) algorithm. The code is based on [this code](https://gist.github.com/kjlubick/8ea239ede6a026a61f4d) written by the creators of the ISMCTS algorithm.

Play by running `py coup.py`
